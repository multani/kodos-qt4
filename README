using Python and PyQt3. You can find this original project at

What is Kodos-Qt4?
------------------

"Kodos-Qt4", as it is currently named, is an effort to rewrite the original
software using the newest PyQt4 library. It aims to give the same level of
functionalities at the original version.

I'm an avid user of Kodos, and as it was the latest software on my computer
which was using Qt3, I thought it was a nice idea to give it a new life; also, I
wanted for a long time to give PyQt4 a try, so, here it is!
